# PATCH-PUMP-FOR-AUTOMATED-INSULIN-DELIVERY
An automated insulin delivery system for a person with diabetes. At the core of the system is an atMega 329p that precisely controls the stepper motor, which serves as the insulin pump mechanism.  The stepper motor is connected to the Arduino through four digital pins, allowing the microcontroller to carefully regulate the stepping sequence.
